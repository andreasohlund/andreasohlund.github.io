<p>Last night I did a talk on how NServiceBus can help you do integrations in a more reliable and scalable way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Developers are dealing with more integrations today than ever before, and handling consistency and reliability across those connections isn't getting any easier either. Many developers are already using NServiceBus in the core parts of their systems for the reliability it brings but aren't aware that it can also help with integration as well. Come see how the saga capabilities in NServiceBus make integration code simpler, more robust, and testable.</p></blockquote>
<p>The talk was recorded by the great folks over at SkillsMatter :</p>
