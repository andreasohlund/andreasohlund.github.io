<p>Last week I did a online presentation for the European Virtual Alt.net on Sagas. The talk gives a basic introduction to sagas and how they are supported in NServiceBus. There was a Q &amp; A at the end where we covered the details on how timeout are managed for sagas.This lead us to discuss how the NServiceBus timeout manager works and considerations for deployment. We also went into how sagas are unit tested and the NServiceBus support in this area.</p>
