<p>If you are reading the excellent <a href="http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com/nhibernate/Default.aspx">NHibernate FAQ Blog</a> you're probably using a <a href="http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com/nhibernate/archive/2008/04/04/identity-field-equality-and-hash-code.aspx">System.Guid as id for your entities</a>. Unfortunately if you are planning to use <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/410.html">NHibernate.Search</a> to enable <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html">Lucent.Net</a> queries against your entities this won't work. NH.Search will throw a:</p>
<p>&quot;Unable to guess IFieldBridge for System.Guid&quot; - Exception</p>
<p>After some debugging (a great way to learn new frameworks) I found the problem. NH.Search has no &quot;bridge&quot; that can convert a Guid to Lucene format. </p>
<p>I got it working by creating my own GuidBridge. This is why I love OSS-projects. If you find a problem you don't have to wait months for someone else to fix it for you!</p>
<p>I've filed a <a href="http://jira.nhibernate.org:8080/jira/browse/NH-1288">patch</a> to the <a href="http://jira.nhibernate.org">NHibernate Jira</a> if you're having the same problem.</p>
