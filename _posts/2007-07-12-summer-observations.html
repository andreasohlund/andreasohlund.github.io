<p>><a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/">Udi </a>has published his <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/07/07/download-vnext-of-the-messaging-infrastructure/">NBus </a>(soon to be an OSS project). I have played around with it and I really like it. Async communication is a key factor for a successful SOA so I think NBus will be a nice addition to my SOA - toolbox. It currently only supports MSMQ-transport but a WCF transport is coming ( I have implemented my own file-based transport just to test it)</p>

A service capsule is a business capability and it's corresponding communication patterns. Go and read it!</p>
