<p>I've been a member of the <a href="http://altnetpedia.com/OverviewWhatIsIt.ashx">ALT.Net community</a>&#160; for a while and really like the idea of choosing the best tools and methods available for development in contrast to always blindly using the tools that comes out of Microsoft. </p>
<p><em>(I'm not saying that MS don't produce good stuff. Visual studio , SQLServer etc is extremely mature and valuable products. )</em></p>
<p>This is the <a href="http://altnetpedia.com/Practices.ashx">ALT.Net definition</a> (quoted from <a href="http://altnetpedia.com">altnetpedia</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Are you...</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The type of developer who uses what works while keeping an eye out for a better way. </li>
<li>You reach outside the mainstream to adopt the best of any community: Open Source, Agile, Java, Ruby, etc. </li>
<li>You&#8217;re not content with the status quo. Things can always be better expressed, more elegant and simple, more mutable, higher quality, etc. </li>
<li>You know tools are great, but they only take you so far. It&#8217;s the principles and knowledge that really matter. The best tools are those that embed the knowledge and encourage the principles (e.g. Resharper.)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sweden-altnet">ALT.Net - Sweden</a> has been around for a while but the fact that it's based in Stockholm makes it hard to attend meetings etc. To remedy this I have decided to start ALT.Net - Sundsvall. I hope that there are allot of developers in Sundsvall that likes the &quot;ALT.Net way&quot; and want's to join in so that we can help each other improve our skills. </p>
<p>I've started a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sundsvall-altdotnet">Google group</a> so if you are interested in ALT.Net and work in the Sundsvall area please join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sundsvall-altdotnet">group</a>!</p>
