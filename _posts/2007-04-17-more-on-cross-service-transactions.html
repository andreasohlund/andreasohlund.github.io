<p>>I while ago I posted my <a href="http://andreasohlund.blogspot.com/2007/02/ws-atomictransaction.html">thoughts</a> about cross service transactions (or rather my disbelief in them).  I just read Juval Lowy's article on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/05/Foundations/default.aspx">WCF transaction propagation</a> in the May issue of MSDN magazine and can't se the need for it. I still firmly believe that transactions between services should be avoided at all costs. <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/blog/">Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz's</a> has published some <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,4dd6c5ca-6e25-4e41-a15f-614d3793dc74.aspx">comments</a> that supports my theory, an there fore it must be true :)</p>
<p>Well, WCF is great but I would rather see that they spend some more time on publish/subscribe support instead of building transactional features.</p>
