<p>When using NServiceBus you define your message contracts using plain C# classes or interfaces. So far so good. In order for NServiceBus to find those classes when scanning your assemblies you need to mark them with the special <em>IMessage </em>interface. This essentially tells us that "hey this is a message definition, please use it". This might seem like a small thing but now you're coupling your message contracts to a NServiceBus assembly since you need to reference the NServiceBus.dll in order get access to the interface. This dependency can cause problems if you have different services that run different versions of NServiceBus. I'm not going into the details since Jonathan Oliver has a <a href="http://blog.jonathanoliver.com/2010/09/nservicebus-distributing-event-schemacontract/">great write up on this very subject</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a big deal for commands because they are always used with in the boundary of a single service and it's fair to require a service to use the same version of NServiceBus. But when it comes to events this becomes more of a problem since requiring all of your services to use the same version of NServiceBus and there by forcing them to upgrade NServiceBus all at once is not an ideal thing.</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways you can solve this. Jonathan mentions a few in his post. NServiceBus 3.0 has a few changes that will help you further.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not bumping the assembly version for non-breaking changes. Following the <a href="http://semver.org">semver.org</a> semantics we only change our assembly version when we make changes that are not backwards compatible. This mean that 3.0.1 and 3.0.X will have this same assembly version, fileversion is of course changed for every release/build. This means that as long as you do a nuget update with the -safe flag your service contracts will stay compatible.</li>
<li>Support for running in what we call "Unobtrusive" mode. Running in unobtrusive mode removes the need for you to reference any NServiceBus assemblies from your own message assemblies. This obviously removes the problem altogether.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Unobtrusive mode</h2>
<p>This new feature in NServiceBus 3.0 allows you to pass in your own conventions to determine which types are message definitions instead of using the <em>IMessage</em> interface.</p>
<p>Below is a snippet that shows how to define those conventions:</p>
<p>[gist id=1482280 ]</p>
<p>The code above tells NServiceBus to treat all interfaces/classes with a namespace that ends with "Messages" as messages. As you see you can also specify conventions for the new <a href="http://andreasohlund.net/2011/12/08/introducing-ievent-and-icommand/">ICommand and IEvent feature</a> as well.</p>
<p>NServiceBus supports property level encryption by using a special <em>WireEncryptedString</em> property and the last line in the snippet is the unobtrusive way to accomplish that encryption.</p>
<p>That is pretty much all there is to it.</p>
<p>A working sample can be found <a href="https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/tree/master/Samples/Unobtrusive">here</a>.</p>
