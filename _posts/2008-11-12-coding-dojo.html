<p>Tonight <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sundsvall-altdotnet">Alt.Net-Sundsvall</a> had it's first meeting. We held a <a href="http://codingdojo.org/">coding dojo</a> where we practiced the famous <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">Bowling Game kata</a>. It was a really good time and a perfect way to share and learn knowledge about, TDD, OO-design, Resharper etc. </p>
<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Make sure everyone knows the problem domain (in our case the rules of bowling)</li>
<li>Only code enough to satisfy the unit tests. We ended up with far to complex implementation in the beginning and had to refactor allot</li>
<li>Order food as soon as possible. &quot;A hungry developer is a crappy developer&quot; :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Images from the epic event can be found <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sundsvall-altdotnet/web/dojo---2008-11-12">here</a>.</p>
<p>And finally a big thanks to <a href="http://steria.se/index.gan?id=11002379">Steria</a> for letting us use their office.</p>
