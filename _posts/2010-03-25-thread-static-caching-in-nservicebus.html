<p>NServiceBus keeps a static pool of threads that process incoming messages. This means that threads are not recreated for each new message with the effect that thread static variables are not cleared.</p>
<div>If you use the thread static cache lifecycle of [Name of your favorite container here] this will have the effect that the objects placed in this cache will not be recreated for each new message as you might expect. The thread static cache is a great way to store objects that should be shared for the duration of each request. One example would be to share the NHibernate session as I have <a href="http://andreasohlund.blogspot.com/2010/02/nhibernate-session-management-in.html">talked about earlier. </a></p>
<div>To remedy this problem for my favorite container StructureMap we need to extend the built-in thread static lifecycle and connect it to the message module feature of NServiceBus in order to clear the cache when message processing is complete.</div>
<div>Our new lifecycle looks like this:</div>
<div>
<pre class="csharp" style="clear: both;">   public class NServiceBusThreadLocalStorageLifestyle : ThreadLocalStorageLifecycle,  IMessageModule   {       public void HandleBeginMessage(){}

       public void HandleEndMessage()       {           EjectAll();       }

       public void HandleError(){}   }</pre>
</div>
<div>To use our new lifecycle we'd have to configure StructureMap with the following syntax:</div>
<div>
<pre class="csharp" style="clear: both;">x.For&lt;ISession&gt;()  .LifecycleIs(new NServiceBusThreadLocalStorageLifestyle())  .Use(ctx =&gt;ctx.GetInstance&lt;ISessionFactory&gt;().OpenSession()));</pre>
<p>The code for my <a href="http://github.com/andreasohlund/Blog/tree/master/NHibernateSample/">NHibernate sample project</a> has been updated to reflect this.</p>
<p>Happy caching!</p>
