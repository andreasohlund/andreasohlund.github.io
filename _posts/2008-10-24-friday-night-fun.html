<p>After a hectic week is always nice to relax by laughing at the mistakes of others :)</p>
<p>Jeremy Miller has shared <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2008/10/23/the-shade-tree-halloween-special.aspx">some of his biggest f*k ups</a> over at his blog.&#160; Thank you Jeremy for helping me to forget that <a href="http://www.episerver.com/en/">EPiServer CMS 5</a> surprisingly doesn't produce W3C-compliant web pages , yuck!!!!!!!</p>
