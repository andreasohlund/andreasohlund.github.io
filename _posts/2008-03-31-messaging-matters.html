<p>>
<p>As a part of the Certified Architect course we where required to write an IT-related paper to get our exam. Inspired by <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/">Udi Dahans</a> article on <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/arcjournal/bb245672.aspx">autonomous services</a> I decided to write a paper on how the choice of messaging patterns between services in an Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) highly affects key quality attributes such as Performance, Scalability and Availability. I also examined how the choice of communication affects the possible use of features offered by an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).</p>
<p>The conclusion was that asynchronous messaging in general and specifically publish/subscribe had the best affect on the examined quality attributes. Further more I concluded that that main reason to implement an ESB should be to support asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>The latter might be stating the obvious but I have on numerous occasions spoken to people that believed that buying an ESB would automatically give them a SOA. An ESB is definitely not a silver bullet that without effort will transform your old applications to a successful SOA.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>The paper can be downloaded from <a href="http://andreasohlund.googlecode.com/files/K29P_Ohlund.pdf">here</a> (unfortunately only in Swedish) </p>
