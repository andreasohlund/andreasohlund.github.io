<p>In September last year I started the <a href="http://www.dfkompetens.se/arkitektur/kurser/2107122/index.xml">&quot;Certified Architect&quot;</a> course held by <a href="http://www.dfs.se/">Dataf&#246;reningen</a>. This is by far the most extensive course I've attended since university. To get your certificate you have to complete 6 x 2 days of lectures and seminars spread over half a year with self studies in between. And finally you're required to write an IT-related paper (more on this in an upcoming post). The course finished last week so now I can call my self a &quot;Certified Architect&quot;. </p>
<p>It took a lot of effort but it was definitely worth it. The thing I will remember most was all the interesting discussions with my 30 fellow architects. Overall it has been a great experience and I can really recommend it if you're interested in IT-Architecture! </p>
