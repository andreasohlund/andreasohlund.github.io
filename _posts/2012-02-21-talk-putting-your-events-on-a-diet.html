<p>Last night I did a talk on event design in service oriented architectures with the abstract.</p>
<blockquote><p>A common problem when designing service oriented architectures is that events going across services tend to be very large in terms of properties they carry. This has the negative effect of making development tougher, testing harder and deployment a risky operation.</p>
<p>In this talk, NServiceBus and Enterprise Software Expert Andreas Ohlund will analyse the checkout process of an online retailer to identify some of the misconceptions that lead to fat events. Finally we'll look at techniques that will help you keep your events small and fit for the purpose thus mitigating the problems above.</p></blockquote>
