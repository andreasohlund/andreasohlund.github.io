<p>This is mostly a note to self since I always seems to forget how to do it:)</p>
<p>To setup a NServiceBus endpoint to make all calls to RavenDB through fiddler you need to do the following:</p>
<p>Configure the proxy for your endpoint by adding the following to your app.config</p>
<p>[gist id=3899134]</p>
<p>With the proxy setup we just need to change the Raven connection string to go through fiddler by adding:</p>
<p>[gist id=3899139]</p>
<p>That should be it, happy debugging!</p>
