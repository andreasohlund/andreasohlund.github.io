<p><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6198-nsbcon">https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6198-nsbcon</a></p>
<p>I'm going to deliver a session on how we do things inside engineering here at Particular. This is a talk that I've been really wanting to do for a long term because I'm leading a truly awesome team and we've really been pushing the boundaries for what I thought was possible in terms of automating of "all the things" :)</p>
<p>The abstract for the talk is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Continuously delivering a top quality platform on which customers build and run their businesses is not a challenge to be taken lightly. Join Andreas Öhlund, Director of Engineering at Particular Software, for a journey through custom tooling, testing the un-testable and massive cloud service bills in the name of backwards compatibility, performance and reliability.</p>
<p>An adventurous journey indeed but an absolute must to ensure that the software you depend on delivers what's stated on the box.</p></blockquote>
<p>The talk will give an in-depth look on what we do to continuously deliver our service platform with the top quality that is expected from us,</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
