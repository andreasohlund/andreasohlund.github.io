<h3>The crew</h3>
<p>As we add support a wider range of tools and technologies there is obviously more work to be done. Even if we invest heavily in automation since we get bored by manual work there is a constant need to grow out team. We've pretty much doubled the Engineering team the last year and those recruitments have mainly come via recommendations from other team members. This seems to work out nicely for us and I'm proud to be directing what by far is the best team I've ever worked with. Since we're full distributed both across countries and across timezones we've had to become experts in async communication but also knowing when it's time to switch to face to face discussions in order to be as effective as possible. With this in place the distributed nature of our team starts to work to our advantage</p>
