<p>You might have wondered why this blog has been so silent, yes I know workload is a poor excuse for not writing blog posts, but the reason is that I've been heads down trying to get NServiceBus v4.0 out of the door. We released v3 March 08 2012 so its been a little over a year since our last major release but finally v4.0 is  now available as release candidate with a go live license. You can read the release notes <a href="http://particular.net/blog/nservicebus-v4.0-release-notes">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another major change it that we renamed the company to Particular Software since we felt that we wanted to broaden our offerings include a range of <a href="http://particular.net/service-platform">other products related</a> to NServiceBus. But hey don't worry we're the same guys writing software particularly for you!</p>
<p>I'll be ramping up my blogging both here and on our new <a href="http://particular.net/blog">company blog</a> going forwards!</p>
