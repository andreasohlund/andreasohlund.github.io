<p>>Subscribing for email alerts using bisubscribe.exe has always been a painful experience at best. Bisubscribe.exe is a powerful tool but it only exist on the TFS machine and the syntax is complicated. But all this has changed when the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/tfseventsubscription">Team Foundation Server Event Subscription Tool </a> was published on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com">codeplex </a>yesterday. It make subscribing to TFS events a walk in the park. Great work guys!!</p>
