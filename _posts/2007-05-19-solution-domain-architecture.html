<p>><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/default.aspx">Nick Malik</a> has a very interesting post about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/05/04/mining-for-services-with-solution-domain-architecture.aspx">Solution Domain Architecture </a>(SDA) which I believe is a great addition to the endless list of methods for <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/serviceengineering/">Service Engineering</a>. I especially like his teory that service reuse is most likely to happen with <em>" 'top down' services that we know, in advance, that we are going to need.  " </em>and any reuse of bottom up services is <em>"is a happy accident". </em>This really highlights the need for SOA-governance in order to have a high degree of reuse of services in your service oriented architecture.</p>
