<p>Working as an IT-Architect you should always strive to recommend the best solution for the specific problem at hand. This is often a pretty easy rule to follow but when it comes to the "You should move towards a Service Oriented Architecture"-advice I haven't had a waterproof explanation why this should be the right path to follow. All the hype and different definitions of SOA has made it a though area to give advice about without becoming a <a href="http://www.booch.com/architecture/blog.jsp?archive=2006-10.html">snake oil salesman</a>.<br />This was until I read Setrag Khoshafian great book on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Enterprises-Setrag-Khoshafian/dp/0849353602">Service Oriented Enterprises</a>. Setrag identifies SOA as an important foundation when digitalizing and automating business processes which in turn is key for effective Enterprice Performance Management (EPM). <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fqHEujhanB4/RZTPJN3p3GI/AAAAAAAAAAU/PKIroIBdEfE/s1600-h/SOE.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5013860042419068002" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="assets/SOE.jpg" border="0" /></a>All this is essential for continuous improvement of your business processes. The image to the right shows the core components of a Service Oriented Enterprise where BPM serves as a bridge between Business and IT. So when customers ask "Why should we invest in SOA?", I think the answer should be: To create the nessesary foundation which enables you to automate your Business Processes which in turn boosts your EPM efforts. I don't think you should expect to save money on these kind of IT-investments but instead it will put you in a better position for meeting the markets demand for rapid adjustments of business processes. And thereby gaining market share from your competitors. </p>
