<p>>In the past all the projects I have been involved in has been developed using "data driven design" i.e. using a relational datamodel as the "blueprint" of the application domain.</p>
<p>But after reading Jimmy Nilsson's great <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples/dp/0321268202/sr=1-1/qid=1167160830/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-3627116-7631914?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">book </a>on <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">DDD </a>I decided to give it a shot.<br />Being a "database guy" I had a hard time not thinking in terms of "how would this look like in a relational database". (Perhaps lobotomy to remove old "database design" thinking should be a prerequisite before trying DDD) :) Well, after spending some time on DDD, I must say that I love it. DDD allows me to focus completly on discovering the modeled domain without beeing distracted with things like "would I use a mapping table here?", etc. In my previous project we used <em>datasets</em> as data carriers and that produced code like:</p>
<p>customerDS.Customer(0).Firstname</p>
<p>But now with my new shiny domain objects (yes I know that custom objects for datatransfer has been around for a long time but with DDD it's mandatory to use them) the code looks like:</p>
<p>customer.Firstname</p>
<p>A lot better if you ask me!</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/">Udi Dahan </a>when he states that DDD requires <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/archives/332">"a higher level of skill to employ"</a><br />But I think this "problem" will fade away as people gets used to "domain driven thinking" and the tools eg. O/R-mappers is getting better and better. The latter is exemplified with the upcoming release of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/">ADO 3.0</a>. Making O/R-mapping a native component of the .Net-framework will certainly give DDD a great boost.</p>
<p>Bottom line:</p>
<p>DDD helps you build more stable, maintainable and testable applications! (I'm also a TDD fan of course...) I'm in! , send me the bill!</p>
