<p><a href="http://pluralsight.com"><img class="alignright" src="assets/logo-v2.png" alt="" width="185" height="40" /></a>My <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/Description/nservicebus">introductory NServiceBus course</a> for <a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> is finally live. It's about 4 hours of content that will get you up to speed with NServiceBus and walk you through how to build message driven systems using a service bus like NServiceBus.</p>
<p>The amount of time spent on recording and edit it could be compared to your average IT-project, initial estimation * PI :)</p>
<p>I've learnt a lot while recording it but listening to my own voice week after week will probably require years of therapy to recover from...</p>
<p>Anyway here's the outline:</p>

<h3>What's next</h3>
<p>There is no content covering sagas since I hope to do a separate course focusing the Saga concept in general, which business problems it can help solve and how its implemented in NServicebus.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
