<p>It's been a long time waiting but today NServiceBus 3.0 was finally released. The team has been working pretty much full time with this release since the  2.6 release in June 2011 and I'm very pleased with the results even if it took a bit longer than we anticipated.</p>
<p>I've often got asked to rank my favorite new features and that's always a though one. But if I have to pick one it would be the native support for RavenDB as our default storage. Using it for a while on both my own projects and customer projects I must say that the easy of use and the dramatic increase in productivity has been much better than I could hope for. Especially sagas are now so much easier to build and maintain without having the burden of the mappings and schema updates that came with the NHibernate persister in 2.X. Sagas has always been the nuclear weapon of NServiceBus and 3.0 takes all this to the next level.</p>
<p>For those of you that are upgrading from 2.X I've prepared a video that walks you through the upgrade process.</p>
