<p>The equivalent to the <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/140289/setting-up-a-rhino-service-bus-application-part-iindash-one-way-bus">one way bus in Rhino Service Bus</a> is what we in NServiceBus call "Send only mode".  In short you would use this in endpoints who's only purpose is  sending messages, websites are often a good example of send only endpoints. I've <a href="http://andreasohlund.net/2010/08/10/send-only-endpoints/">blogged about it </a>a while back but the syntax has changed slightly since then. This time we'll take closer look at the code needed to start in send only mode.</p>
<p>[gist id=1417373]</p>
<p>The only configuration needed when running in this mode is the destination of the messages you're sending, you can do this either <a href="http://nservicebus.com/docs/Samples/FullDuplex.aspx">inline or through configuration</a>.</p>
<p>A working sample can be found <a href="https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/tree/develop/Samples/SendOnlyEndpoint">here</a>.</p>
<p>That's really all there is to it.</p>
