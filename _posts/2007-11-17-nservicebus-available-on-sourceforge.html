<p>>
<p>Udi has <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nservicebus">released</a> NServiceBus to sourceforge. I really believe in the concept so hopefully I will have some time to contribute. Primarily I like to update my <a href="http://andreasohlund.blogspot.com/2007/07/filebased-transport-for-nbus.html">file based transport</a> to support the new ITransport interface. </p>
