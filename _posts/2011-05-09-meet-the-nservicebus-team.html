<p>For you that couldn't get a seat at the <a href="http://devsum.se/workshops/" target="_blank">NServiceBus workshop at devsum11</a> there is another chance to get a first hand look at NServiceBus.</p>
<p>I'm hosting a <a href="http://www.epostservice.se/read.asp?issueid=125025" target="_blank">free NServiceBus event together with Udi Dahan in Stockholm May 19:th</a> 18.00 - 21.00 and there  are still some seats left if you're interested.</p>
